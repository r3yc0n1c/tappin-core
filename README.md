### Decentralized physical infrastructure network for AI as a training service

# what is TAppIN?

TAppIN is a decentralized physical infrastructure network for AI as a training service. This utilizes something called DePIN. Here we leverage the blockchain network to organize and manage the physical hardware network and in the end allow users to use desired machines for training their AI models. Users with higher specs can list their devices in this network and thus earn too, and a well maintained use of excess resources, indeed.

# Uniqueness

Use of DePIN in making the service.

# what is our earning model?

On each transaction, yes, for every transaction that occurs, we charge a modest fee, that is our entire business model.
